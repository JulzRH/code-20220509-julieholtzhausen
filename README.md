Hi thereI haven't  worked with creating packages before, and while I've found a way to build the package, I can't figure out how to run or test it within reasonabletime limits. As a result, I have uploaded two folders. The first 'script' contains just the script and tests to complete the task. The second 'build' contains my efforts to build a package. Each contains their own README docs forfurther info on how to run etc.Julie
